# Two-stream activity recognition on UCF-101
This repository is a modification of the Two-Stream network based on ![Jeffrey Huang's work](https://github.com/jeffreyhuang1/two-stream-action-recognition 
):  
and ![Dan Bochman's](https://github.com/danbochman/Real-Time-Action-Recognition) addition of the Non-Local Block to enhance the spatial CNN of the Two-Stream network:
